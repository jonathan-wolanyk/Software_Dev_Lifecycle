# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs can be gathered through personal experiences, direct conversations, or reports from those who are more familiar with the user. In order to interpret the needs, one must use their own intuition to theorize the true intention behind the need, whether it be to facilitate a better workflow, to bridge a communication gap, or any other need a user may encounter. User stories are a way of standardizing interactions or proposed needs and help guide a team to interpret the ultimate goal of the end-user or client.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I start by understanding the overall goal of the program. Once I understand the purpose of the project, I make a design document that outlines integral parts of the program that could stand alone as a product. I develop incrementally and ensure each facet of the project is functional and cohesive before launching the program. This is the general outline of an agile framework; I gather user stories, work in sprints, and deliver functional pieces of the program at the end of each section of the project.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development fully embraces the agile principles of transparency and openness. It is important to collaborate with one’s peers to create code that is understandable to testers, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners alike. A good team member is fully attentive when working with his or her peers, and is committed to developing quality products that satisfy the needs of both the client and end-user alike.
